# Gap Open Source Organization

## Background

Open Source Frameworks being released at a record pass (Tensorflow, Theano, Caffe, Keras, MXNet, Neon, ...).

    - The frameworks with wide adoption are supported and sponsored by the Big 5 (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) and others.

    - Mass technical staff, years in development, deep pocket budgets.

On this scale, is it realistic anymore for a grassroots open source project to release a machine learning framework of the same caliber and adoption?

## Purpose / Reason

Why us, why this project?
